Young is the day
Leaving dark dismay
For a single thread I pray
Which keeps all at bay

Light and life
Strength from vain strife
Through, cuts the knife
Now ripples in rife

Old is the night
Fleeing white fright
A new day will come
First death then light

Then death again
Blood from cold pen
Screech from young hen
Life comes again
